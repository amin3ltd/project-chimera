# Project Chimera - Cursor Rules

## Project Context
This is Project Chimera, an Autonomous Influencer Network. The system creates AI agents that research trends, generate content, and manage social media engagement without human intervention.

## Core Architecture
- **FastRender Swarm Pattern**: Planner → Worker → Judge roles
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Universal connectivity layer
- **Agentic Commerce**: Coinbase AgentKit integration for financial autonomy

## Prime Directive
**NEVER generate code without checking `specs/` first.** All implementation must align with the specification documents.

## Development Rules

### Before Writing Code
1. Check `specs/functional.md` for user stories and requirements
2. Check `specs/technical.md` for API contracts and schemas
3. Check `specs/_meta.md` for project vision and constraints

### Code Standards
- Use Pydantic for all data schemas
- Follow the Planner-Worker-Judge pattern for agent logic
- All external interactions must go through MCP
- Write tests before implementation (TDD approach)

### File Locations
- Specifications: `specs/`
- Agent Skills: `skills/`
- Tests: `tests/`
- Research Notes: `research/`

## Traceability
When making changes:
1. Explain your plan before writing code
2. Reference the relevant spec requirement
3. Document any deviations from specs
