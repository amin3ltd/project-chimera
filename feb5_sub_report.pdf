0 -13 Td
(Executive Summary) Tj
0 -13 Td
(Lemlem discovered **non-trivial reconciliation gaps** between Finance and Delivery during) Tj
0 -13 Td
(proactive validation. Because the program is on a fast-track schedule with no validation) Tj
0 -13 Td
(buffer, the immediate goal is to secure **client agreement for a time-boxed investigation** to) Tj
0 -13 Td
(isolate whether gaps are caused by data quality, timing/reporting windows, or definition) Tj

(Scenario) Tj
0 -13 Td
(Lemlem is a recently appointed mid-level Data Engineer tasked with spearheading the development) Tj
0 -13 Td
(of a centralized data warehouse for a primary client. As a new addition to the team, Lemlem) Tj
0 -13 Td
(faces the "Liability of Newness"-a sociological phenomenon where a lack of established trust) Tj
0 -13 Td
(and institutional knowledge complicates the navigation of internal politics. This role serves) Tj
0 -13 Td
(as Lemlem's debut in high-stakes client delivery, requiring a delicate balance between) Tj
0 -13 Td
(technical rigor and executive diplomacy.) Tj
0 -13 Td
() Tj
0 -13 Td
(The project environment is characterized by a significant internal schism regarding digital) Tj
0 -13 Td
(transformation. While senior leadership views the centralized warehouse as a catalyst for) Tj
0 -13 Td
(organizational scaling, the operational staff exhibits varying degrees of "information) Tj
0 -13 Td
(hoarding." This defensive posture suggests a perceived threat to departmental autonomy or a) Tj
0 -13 Td
(fear of exposure regarding legacy process inefficiencies. Consequently, data discovery is) Tj
0 -13 Td
(hindered by stakeholders who are protective of their datasets and resistant to cross-functional) Tj
0 -13 Td
(inquiry.) Tj
0 -13 Td
() Tj
0 -13 Td
(The project is currently operating under a compressed "fast-track" schedule with zero allocated) Tj
0 -13 Td
(buffer for iterative validation. The discovery of discrepancies between Finance and Delivery) Tj
0 -13 Td
(datasets introduces a critical project management dilemma. Because the project plan is rigid,) Tj
0 -13 Td
(the effort required for a comprehensive root-cause analysis represents a zero-sum trade-off.) Tj
0 -13 Td
(Lemlem must navigate the "Project Management Triangle," where the pursuit of data integrity) Tj
0 -13 Td
(\(Quality\) directly threatens either the project timeline \(Time\) or the team's human capital) Tj
0 -13 Td
(\(Scope/Burnout\), necessitating a strategic decision on resource prioritization.) Tj
0 -13 Td
() Tj
0 -13 Td
(During validation that you undertook on your own, you discover some curious discrepancies) Tj
0 -13 Td
(between finance data and delivery data. Totals and counts do not fully reconcile.) Tj
0 -13 Td
() Tj
0 -13 Td
(The root cause is unclear. Possible explanations include:) Tj
0 -13 Td
(* Data quality issues) Tj
0 -13 Td
(* Timing/reporting differences) Tj

(* Definition mismatches) Tj
