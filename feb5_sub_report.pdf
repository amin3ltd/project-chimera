(Persona) Tj
0 -13 Td
(**You are Lemlem**, a data team member building a client's data warehouse.) Tj

() Tj
0 -13 Td
(Executive Summary) Tj
0 -13 Td
(Lemlem discovered **non-trivial reconciliation gaps** between Finance and Delivery during) Tj
0 -13 Td
(proactive validation. Because the program is on a fast-track schedule with no validation) Tj
0 -13 Td
(buffer, the immediate goal is to secure **client agreement for a time-boxed investigation** to) Tj
0 -13 Td
(isolate whether gaps are caused by data quality, timing/reporting windows, or definition) Tj
0 -13 Td
(mismatches-before these issues become embedded in the warehouse as "truth.") Tj
0 -13 Td
() Tj
0 -13 Td
(This report includes a **client-ready update** that balances urgency with diplomacy, proposes a) Tj
0 -13 Td
(concrete and limited scope, and requests explicit approval to allocate time to root-cause the) Tj
0 -13 Td
(discrepancies.) Tj

(Scenario) Tj
0 -13 Td
(Lemlem is a recently appointed mid-level Data Engineer tasked with spearheading the development) Tj
0 -13 Td
(of a centralized data warehouse for a primary client. As a new addition to the team, Lemlem) Tj
0 -13 Td
(faces the "Liability of Newness"-a sociological phenomenon where a lack of established trust) Tj
0 -13 Td
(and institutional knowledge complicates the navigation of internal politics. This role serves) Tj
0 -13 Td
(as Lemlem's debut in high-stakes client delivery, requiring a delicate balance between) Tj
0 -13 Td
(technical rigor and executive diplomacy.) Tj
0 -13 Td
() Tj
0 -13 Td
(The project environment is characterized by a significant internal schism regarding digital) Tj
0 -13 Td
(transformation. While senior leadership views the centralized warehouse as a catalyst for) Tj
0 -13 Td
(organizational scaling, the operational staff exhibits varying degrees of "information) Tj
0 -13 Td
(hoarding." This defensive posture suggests a perceived threat to departmental autonomy or a) Tj
0 -13 Td
(fear of exposure regarding legacy process inefficiencies. Consequently, data discovery is) Tj
0 -13 Td
(hindered by stakeholders who are protective of their datasets and resistant to cross-functional) Tj
0 -13 Td
(inquiry.) Tj
0 -13 Td
() Tj
0 -13 Td
(The project is currently operating under a compressed "fast-track" schedule with zero allocated) Tj
0 -13 Td
(buffer for iterative validation. The discovery of discrepancies between Finance and Delivery) Tj
0 -13 Td
(datasets introduces a critical project management dilemma. Because the project plan is rigid,) Tj
0 -13 Td
(the effort required for a comprehensive root-cause analysis represents a zero-sum trade-off.) Tj
0 -13 Td
(Lemlem must navigate the "Project Management Triangle," where the pursuit of data integrity) Tj
0 -13 Td
(\(Quality\) directly threatens either the project timeline \(Time\) or the team's human capital) Tj
0 -13 Td
(\(Scope/Burnout\), necessitating a strategic decision on resource prioritization.) Tj
0 -13 Td
() Tj
0 -13 Td
(During validation that you undertook on your own, you discover some curious discrepancies) Tj
0 -13 Td
(between finance data and delivery data. Totals and counts do not fully reconcile.) Tj
0 -13 Td
() Tj
0 -13 Td
(The root cause is unclear. Possible explanations include:) Tj
0 -13 Td
(* Data quality issues) Tj
0 -13 Td
(* Timing/reporting differences) Tj

(* Definition mismatches) Tj

(understand how the two datasets relate and what could prevent reconciliation at scale.) Tj

(### 1\) Duplicate or replayed Finance records \(double-count risk\)) Tj
0 -13 Td
(Some orders/packages appear twice in Finance with the same amount/date/status, which inflates) Tj
0 -13 Td
(totals if summed naively.) Tj
0 -13 Td
(* Example patterns observed: same `order_id` + `package_id` + `payment_date` + `amount` +) Tj
0 -13 Td

0 -13 Td
() Tj
0 -13 Td
(### 2\) Missing or incomplete join keys \(unmatchable records\)) Tj
0 -13 Td
(Finance contains at least one row where `package_id` is blank. If Delivery joins rely on) Tj
0 -13 Td
(`order_id + package_id`, these rows cannot reconcile until the key is corrected or mapped.) Tj
0 -13 Td
() Tj
0 -13 Td
(### 3\) Timing / reporting window differences \(month boundary drift\)) Tj
0 -13 Td
(Several deliveries occur days later \(e.g., paid in late January, delivered in early February\).) Tj
0 -13 Td
(Monthly reporting will diverge if Finance is grouped by `payment_date` while Delivery is) Tj
0 -13 Td
(grouped by `event_time`.) Tj
0 -13 Td
() Tj
0 -13 Td
(### 4\) Definition mismatches \(paid != delivered\)) Tj
0 -13 Td
(Delivery includes non-delivery outcomes \(`FAILED`, `RETURNED`\). If Finance reports "PAID" and) Tj
0 -13 Td
(Delivery reports "DELIVERED," these won't tie out without agreed business rules \(e.g., whether) Tj
0 -13 Td

0 -13 Td
(The sample includes payments for orders/packages that do not appear in the Delivery extract and) Tj
0 -13 Td
(vice versa \(depending on extract completeness\). In a warehouse, we need to know whether that) Tj

(between the Finance payments extract and the Delivery status extract. We're seeing) Tj

0 -13 Td
(Finance and "delivered" outcomes in Delivery.) Tj
0 -13 Td
() Tj
0 -13 Td
(At this stage, the root cause is **not yet confirmed**. Based on what we see so far, the gaps) Tj
0 -13 Td
(are consistent with common legacy-system patterns such as:) Tj
0 -13 Td
(* **Duplicate/replayed payments** \(same order/package/amount/date appearing more than once\),) Tj
0 -13 Td
(which can inflate Finance totals if not deduplicated.) Tj
0 -13 Td
(* **Missing or inconsistent join keys** \(e.g., a blank `package_id`\), which makes some Finance) Tj
0 -13 Td
(records unmatchable to Delivery.) Tj
0 -13 Td
(* **Timing differences** \(e.g., paid late in month, delivered early next month\), which causes) Tj
0 -13 Td
(month-end drift depending on which timestamp is used.) Tj
0 -13 Td
(* **Definition differences** \(e.g., Finance "PAID" vs Delivery outcomes like) Tj
0 -13 Td
(`FAILED`/`RETURNED`\), which require agreed business rules for reporting.) Tj

0 -13 Td
(To avoid locking incorrect assumptions into the warehouse, we recommend a **time-boxed) Tj
0 -13 Td

0 -13 Td
(1\) agreed metric definitions \("paid," "delivered," "returned/refunded," etc.\),) Tj
0 -13 Td
(2\) deduplication + join keys/rules,) Tj
0 -13 Td
(3\) a small set of known exceptions \(and how they will show up in dashboards\).) Tj

0 -13 Td
(**Options:**) Tj
0 -13 Td
(* **Option A \(recommended\):** Approve the 1-2 day time-box now to confirm root causes and) Tj
0 -13 Td
(finalize rules before we publish executive metrics.) Tj
0 -13 Td
(* **Option B:** Continue on the current schedule with provisional rules \(higher risk of later) Tj
0 -13 Td
(rework and reporting disputes\).) Tj
0 -13 Td
() Tj
0 -13 Td
(**Recommendation:** Option A. This is the smallest investment that materially reduces the risk) Tj
0 -13 Td
(of stakeholder misalignment later.) Tj

(Please confirm whether we can proceed with **Option A** and identify 1 Finance + 1 Delivery) Tj
