# Project Chimera - Meta Specification

## Vision
Build an Autonomous AI Influencer Network capable of:
- Researching and identifying trends
- Generating multimodal content (text, images, video)
- Managing social media engagement autonomously
- Executing financial transactions via Agentic Commerce

## Core Principles
1. **Spec-Driven Development**: Specs are the source of truth
2. **MCP-First Architecture**: All external interactions via Model Context Protocol
3. **Swarm Coordination**: FastRender Pattern (Planner/Worker/Judge)
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Safety governance for high-risk actions

## Constraints
- Maximum 10-second latency for high-priority interactions
- Mandatory AI disclosure on all published content
- Non-custodial wallet management via Coinbase AgentKit
- HITL escalation for confidence scores < 0.70

## Success Criteria
- Repository ready for AI swarm development
- Executable specs (API schemas, DB ERDs)
- Failing tests defining implementation goals
- CI/CD pipeline with automated governance
