# Feb 5 Submission Report — Delivery Challenge

## Title
**The Delivery Challenge**

## Persona
**You are Lemlem**, a data team member building a client’s data warehouse.

## Scenario
Lemlem is a recently appointed mid-level Data Engineer tasked with spearheading the development of a centralized data warehouse for a primary client. As a new addition to the team, Lemlem faces the "Liability of Newness"—a sociological phenomenon where a lack of established trust and institutional knowledge complicates the navigation of internal politics. This role serves as Lemlem’s debut in high-stakes client delivery, requiring a delicate balance between technical rigor and executive diplomacy.

The project environment is characterized by a significant internal schism regarding digital transformation. While senior leadership views the centralized warehouse as a catalyst for organizational scaling, the operational staff exhibits varying degrees of "information hoarding." This defensive posture suggests a perceived threat to departmental autonomy or a fear of exposure regarding legacy process inefficiencies. Consequently, data discovery is hindered by stakeholders who are protective of their datasets and resistant to cross-functional inquiry.

The project is currently operating under a compressed "fast-track" schedule with zero allocated buffer for iterative validation. The discovery of discrepancies between Finance and Delivery datasets introduces a critical project management dilemma. Because the project plan is rigid, the effort required for a comprehensive root-cause analysis represents a zero-sum trade-off. Lemlem must navigate the "Project Management Triangle," where the pursuit of data integrity (Quality) directly threatens either the project timeline (Time) or the team’s human capital (Scope/Burnout), necessitating a strategic decision on resource prioritization.

During validation that you undertook on your own, you discover some curious discrepancies between finance data and delivery data. Totals and counts do not fully reconcile.

The root cause is unclear. Possible explanations include:
- Data quality issues
- Timing/reporting differences
- Definition mismatches
- Team misunderstanding
- Something nefarious
- System inconsistencies

There is no evidence of wrongdoing, yet.

Your manager asks you to draft a client update to ask for agreement to allocate some time to look into the discrepancies.
